		<p> Welcome! As a Jr. Web Developer, I began my coding journey in 2016 when I enrolled at Wyncode Academy. My time as a coder has been challenging, fruststrating, and most of all, rewarding. My skillset is growing every day, and I look forward to the challenges that lay ahead. My core technologies include Ruby, Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap, and SQL. </p>
